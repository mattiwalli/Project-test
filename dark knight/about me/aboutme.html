            Hi! My name is Matti, I'm currently studying to become a Front-End
            Developer at Grit Academy, where I'm diving deep into the world of
            web development and coding. Before this, I've spent the last six
            years working as an Aktivitetsledare (Activity Leader), which has
            taught me a lot about organization, creativity, and working with
            people. In my free time, I love playing games, watching movies, and
            hanging out with friends. Whether it's exploring new places or just
            relaxing and enjoying good food, I'm always up for a good time. I'm
            passionate about tech, creativity, and finding new ways to challenge
            myself!
